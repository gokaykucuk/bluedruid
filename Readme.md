#  Bluedruid

Bluedruid is a FaunaDB orm library. The has few aims;
 - Simple accessor or writer functions to use in everyday cases(ex: finding an element by a property)
 - A schema helper that lets us describe the state of the database in a consistent way
 - Making it easier to create complex indexes(ex: autocomplete index)
 
The focus is not supporting everything *fauna* package provides, but to rather
limit them in a more relational friendly way.
